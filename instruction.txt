This Shop APi was Created by Hoang Le 
Main function: User can buy items that is in items list, every time user by an item they put item name, user name, and quantity. If items in stock then it will update shopping cart. If out of stock then transaction failed. Also if you put wrong item name or user name, application will not do any transaction. 


Database in this project is H2 database, to check the database use http://localhost:8080/h2-console 
When start the project, find this line on console window to get connect information to connect with database:

2020-09-11 02:16:01.349  INFO 6288 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.b.a.h2.H2ConsoleAutoConfiguration    : H2 console available at '/h2-console'. Database available at 'jdbc:h2:mem:92683abd-2178-47d9-93a6-e4dc4f013046'

I added some dummy data into database every time the application restart 
Database include: 
AppUser : 
	Id : 1 , username : admin
	Id : 2, username :hoangle
Items: 
	Id : 1 , Item_name : item1 , item_price: 50.0, item_quantity: 20
